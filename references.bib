	abstract = {The {ICESat}-2 {ATL}08 land and vegetation product includes several flags that can be used for the assessment of {LiDAR}-environment interactions and can help select data of the highest quality. However, the usability of these flags has not been sufficiently studied to date. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of atmospheric scattering, the presence of snow, canopy cover, terrain slope, beam strength, and solar angle on the accuracy of terrain and canopy height of the {ATL}08 product as well as on providing recommendations on how to filter data in order to minimize errors. We evaluated the vertical accuracy of {ATL}08 terrain and canopy height in European mountains by comparing them with the digital terrain model and canopy height model derived from airborne laser scanning data. Our results indicate that the assessment of atmospheric effects using the cloud confidence flag (cloud\_flag\_atm; i.e. number of cloud layers) is better than the previously used multiple scattering warning flag (msw\_flag). Day acquisitions with more than one layer of clouds yielded a terrain elevation {RMSE} of 3.22 m in forests while night acquisitions with no more than a single layer of clouds resulted in {RMSE} of 1.73 m. The increasing atmospheric scattering effects increased the photons' path length, resulting in terrain height underestimation. The presence of snow had a strong positive effect on the number of identified ground photons, independently of the canopy cover, but resulted in an overestimation of terrain height in higher altitudes. Accordingly, the presence of snow cover resulted in a significant underestimation of canopy height in forests. The canopy height in broadleaf/mixed as well as coniferous forests was in summer underestimated on average by 2.1 m (\%{ME} of −15.3\%) and 1.2 m (\%{ME} of −8.2\%), respectively; in winter, however, the underestimation increased to 8.5 m (\%{ME} of −56.8\%) and 5.7 m (\%{ME} of −38.3\%), respectively. Canopy height estimates had better accuracy for the strong beam ({RMSE} of 5.09 m; \%{RMSE} of 35.4\%) than for the weak beam ({RMSE} of 7.03 m; \%{RMSE} of 51.3\%). Our results show that the {ATL}08 terrain height accuracy decreases with uneven distribution of signal photons within individual segments and further deteriorates with increasing terrain slope. Filtering out segments with poor distribution of photons, more than one layer of clouds during the day, and snow cover in high altitudes is the best approach for minimizing the error while maximizing the number of segments left for subsequent analysis.},

	abstract = {There is a lack of guidance on the choice of the spatial grain of predictor and response variables in species distribution models ({SDM}). This review summarizes the current state of the art with regard to the following points: (i) the effects of changing the resolution of predictor and response variables on model performance; (ii) the effect of conducting multi-grain versus single-grain analysis on model performance; and (iii) the role of land cover type and spatial autocorrelation in selecting the appropriate grain size. In the reviewed literature, we found that coarsening the resolution of the response variable typically leads to declining model performance. Therefore, we recommend aiming for finer resolutions unless there is a reason to do otherwise (e.g. expert knowledge of the ecological scale). We also found that so far, the improvements in model performance reported for multi-grain models have been relatively low and that useful predictions can be generated even from single-scale models. In addition, the use of high-resolution predictors improves model performance; however, there is only limited evidence on whether this applies to models with coarser-resolution response variables (e.g. 100 km2 and coarser). Low-resolution predictors are usually sufficient for species associated with fairly common environmental conditions but not for species associated with less common ones (e.g. common vs rare land cover category). This is because coarsening the resolution reduces variability within heterogeneous predictors and leads to underrepresentation of rare environments, which can lead to a decrease in model performance. Thus, assessing the spatial autocorrelation of the predictors at multiple grains can provide insights into the impacts of coarsening their resolution on model performance. Overall, we observed a lack of studies examining the simultaneous manipulation of the resolution of predictor and response variables. We stress the need to explicitly report the resolution of all predictor and response variables.},

	shorttitle = {How has bird biodiversity changed over time?},
	abstract = {Empirical quantification of biodiversity changes remains a challenge even in well surveyed groups such as birds. This may be because the change depends on spatio-temporal scales, specifically on spatial grain (i.e. average unit of area of the sampling or the analysis), geographic extent (i.e. size of the area of interest), temporal grain (i.e. average unit of duration of the sampling or the analysis), and temporal extent (i.e. length of the time series). Further, different metrics of biodiversity may exhibit different trends. Here we review the literature assessing the temporal trends of avian biodiversity from ca. 1900 {AD} to present, focusing on studies summarising trends across many locations within a larger region (i.e. spatially replicated). From each study we extracted direction of average trend (increase, decrease, stable), spatial and temporal grains and extents at which the trends have been assessed, metrics of biodiversity, and location. We then discuss the trends as a function of the spatio-temporal grains and extents they are defined at. We found 59 trends of 12 metrics, where each trend is an average of trends from multiple sites (spatial replicates). There was a tendency of biodiversity metrics to increase at local and regional spatial scales, and to decrease globally. We thus confirmed that biodiversity dynamics can have opposite trends at different spatial scales. Concerning temporal grain, it was poorly documented across the studies, with inconsistent and/or confusing definitions. We suggest a common framework to better understand the link between temporal scales and biodiversity dynamics. We have also identified underrepresented regions (those outside North America and Europe), periods (those before the 70′s), and biodiversity metrics that need further attention. We highlight the importance of considering both spatial and temporal scaling jointly in any assessment of biodiversity change, and provide guidelines for specifying spatio-temporal features (i.e. grain, lag and extent) effectively both in birds, and in other taxa.},

	abstract = {Temporal biodiversity change involves colonization, extinction, and recurrence of species. These processes vary with spatial grain (i.e. the area at which biodiversity is assessed), but there is little theory to explain this. Here, we present theoretical scenarios showing that colonization, extinction, and recurrence of species can either increase or decrease in strength across grain size. We tested for these patterns in empirical data on Czech birds over 30 years, and several orders of magnitude of spatial grain. We found that colonization increased from local to national scales, while extinctions followed a hump‐shaped pattern, leading to a higher temporal increase of richness towards coarse grains. Probabilities of colonization and extinction decreased with grain size, with a steeper decrease for extinction. Our results hold independently across two time periods (1985–2002 and 2002–2017), and colonization is the dominant process behind temporal change of richness. This decomposition of biodiversity change allowed us to identify scale‐wise ecological mechanisms driving biodiversity change, and explain seemingly confusing directions of biodiversity change at different spatial scales.},

	doi = {10.32942/X21032},
	abstract = {Acceleration of human activities over the past century might have caused a corresponding acceleration in the decline of abundance of species, but this has not been empirically assessed. Further, the temporal dynamics of abundance arises from a complex interaction between recruitment and loss of individuals, which remains unexplored across large spatial scales. We address these gaps by examining temporal changes, acceleration, deceleration, and vital processes (i.e. recruitment and loss) across much of the North American avifauna from 1987 to 2021. We confirm the continent-wide decline of bird abundance, and pinpoint the regional hotspots of acceleration of this decline in the Mid-Atlantic region, Midwest, and California, matching broad spatial patterns of human activities. We further reveal that the increasing rate of loss is the primary process responsible for the acceleration of abundance decline in California and the Midwest, whereas a decrease in recruitment rate dominates in the Mid-Atlantic. Finally, we highlight a worrisome trend: 96\% of bird species and 100\% of families with increasing abundances are concurrently experiencing a decline in recruitment rate. Thus, we need conservation policies even for species that appear to be thriving. Further, simply preventing loss may not be enough, as we also need policies that enhance recruitment.},
